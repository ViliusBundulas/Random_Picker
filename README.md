# Random_Picker
Picks random student from the list

The idea was generated when we did pair programming in our class and teacher always needed to choose random student from the list.

1.) Picks a random student from the list
2.) Shows progress bar
3.) Shows alert if missing students in the class

Coming soon... Save to user defaults the last lesson progress.
